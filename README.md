This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model for drug reviews utilizing deep learning technology. Developing a model which has the ability to understand the sentiment expressed in patient reviews of pharmaceutical drugs is of paramount importance as it allows us to identify the side effects, assess the treatments effectiveness, helps to understand the patients experience and enables early detection of issues. This meaningful information helps healthcare professionals make informed decisions, improve the patients care and pay attention to the drug monitoring process. This thorough analysis also helps public make smart
and informed decisions about medicines and health care.
